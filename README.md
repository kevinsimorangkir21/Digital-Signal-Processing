## Description

The term "hands-on" refers to a practical, interactive approach to learning or doing something, emphasizing direct experience and active participation rather than theoretical instruction. It often implies engaging directly with materials or processes to gain skills or knowledge. For example, a "hands-on workshop" would allow participants to actively practice what they are learning, rather than just listening to lectures or watching demonstrations.
